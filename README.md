# [TTK7 - Adaptive Data Analysis: Theory and Applications](https://www.itk.ntnu.no/emner/fordypning/TTK7)

**Course content:** The objective of this course it to gain a better understanding of classical data analysis and adaptive data analysis methods, with a focus on their applicability to data from complex systems.

This course examined the advantages and disadvantages of a priori and adaptive data analysis methods, by implemetning, using real data from various processes and systems, time-frequency analysis methods and spectral analysis. Examples of implementation used Short-Time Fourier transform, Wavelet transforms, Hilbert-Huang transform, Bayesian methods, Kalman filtering. etc. In the implemetnations, emphasis will be put on the understanding of time-frequency concept and the related Heisenberg-Gabor Limit.

**Project:** In this course, we had a project in which we applied adaptive filtering to a real dataset. Our dataset was electrical signals measured at 60 output points from a microelectrode array (MEA). Our results were presented in our report "Long-term frequency band characteristics of a stimulated stem cell-derived dopaminergic neuronal culture".
